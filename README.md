# ACTR-ME: ACT-R, Made Easy

![image](logo.png) A Python package to use ACT-R to analyze behavioral data.

## Why?

ACT-R is a much better _theory_ to explain behavior that most other models, but researchers still 
prefer other packages such DDM, RL. In fact, even memory researchers seem to prefer DDM or RL to ACT-R.
Why? Most psych/neuro folks want to use models to measure and compare things (patients, conditions, items) 
on their way to understand the mind. ACT-R __can__ do that, but not in an easy way that fits with the typical, 
data analysis workflow of behavioral researchers.
